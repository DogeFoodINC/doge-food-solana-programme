# Solana Dog Food Payment & Splitter Program

This Solana-based program facilitates payments for dog food on a website and automatically splits incoming payments between two wallets. 80% of the funds are allocated to the team wallet, while 20% is directed to a donation wallet, ensuring a smooth and transparent process for both business and charity. (Percentage split is configurable)

# Features

> - Payment Acceptance: Accepts payments for dog food via Solana transactions.
> - Automatic Payment Split: 80% of the incoming payment goes to the team wallet, and 20% is sent to a donation wallet.
> - Seamless Integration: Can be integrated into a website to accept payments directly from users.
> - Transparent Donation: Helps track donations made towards a specific cause (e.g., charity or animal rescue).

# Architecture

The program is built on Solana's blockchain and uses smart contracts to:

> - Checks and processes incoming orders.
> - Split the payments according to predefined percentages (80% to the team, 20% to donations).
> - Ensure the funds are transferred securely and automatically to the designated wallets.
